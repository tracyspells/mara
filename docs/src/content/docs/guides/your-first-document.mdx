## What are Documents?

Documents are the heart and soul of Mara. They are containers that hold "contents" (state, if you will), and you can watch their contents and modify them at any point in time.

## Creating a document

Creating documents is simple and straightforward. Here are some examples of what a document might look like:

<Tabs>

<TabItem label = "Counter" icon = "up-caret">

    ```lua title="counter.luau" showLineNumbers
    local Mara = require(ReplicatedStorage.Packages.Mara)

    local createDocument = Mara.createDocument

    type Document<Contents> = Mara.Document<Contents>

    type Contents = number

    local counter = createDocument(0) :: Document<Contents>

    return counter
    ```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label = "Todos" icon = "approve-check">

    ```lua title="todos.luau" showLineNumbers
    local Mara = require(ReplicatedStorage.Packages.Mara)

    local createDocument = Mara.createDocument

    type Document<Contents> = Mara.Document<Contents>

    type Contents = {
        todos: { string },
    }

    local todos = createDocument({
        todos = {}
    }) :: Document<Contents>

    return todos
    ```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label = "Player Data" icon = "open-book">

    ```lua title="playerData.luau" showLineNumbers
    local Mara = require(ReplicatedStorage.Packages.Mara)

    local createDocument = Mara.createDocument

    type Document<Contents> = Mara.Document<Contents>

    type Contents = {
        coins: number,
        exp: number,
        health: number,
        weapons: { string },
    }

    local playerData = createDocument({
        coins = 0,
        exp = 0,
        health = 0,
        weapons = { "Basic Sword" }
     }) :: Document<Contents>

    return playerData
    ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

As stated earlier, documents contain contents. Document contents aren't limited to regular arrays and dictionaries; they can be whatever you want (with some exceptions).

Mara treats document contents as [immutable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object) â€” meaning, you can't modify them directly. Instead, you provide new contents that overwrite the existing ones.

## Using your document

Now that we've created our document, we can tune in whenever the document's contents changes. For example, let's take our `Counter` document and increase our counter:

```lua showLineNumbers
local counter = require(script.Parent.counter)

counter:changed(function(count: number)
    print("Count: "..count)
end)

counter:edit(function(count: number)
    return count + 1
end)
```

```lua
--> Count: 1
```

We use `:edit()` to modify our counter, and [`:changed()`](/guides/document-changes/) to listen for changes to our counter.
