description: A brief introduction to Mara.

_Mara_ is a lightweight state container that allows you to write simple code to manage state in Roblox.
It is inspired by [Reflex](https://littensy.github.io/reflex/), [Valtio](https://valtio.pmnd.rs/) and [Fusion](https://elttob.uk/Fusion/0.2/).

## Why Mara?
Dealing with state should be simple and straightforward. 

Mara accomplishes this by stepping away from the Redux model, and tackles state management in a different way.

It's as simple as 1, 2, 3.
